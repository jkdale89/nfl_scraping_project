# nfl_scraping_project

This project attempts to scrape data on historical nfl gambling lines and results, then eventually to visualize this with d3

update 7/10

all backend / data stuff is stored in the "data" folder.

The working data is in "./working_data";

Big scatter charts working for every year, filtering teams and years is good to go, too. Still a bit of refactoring to do, and trying to finish the over / under and moneyline graphs. But most of this is working.

The point of this app is not so much to be useful, as it is to do it. I wanted to do some webscraping, aggregate it, and visualize it in d3. This is a decent start.
